# AI-Driven Phishing Detection and Response System

An innovative project leveraging AI Agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and respond to phishing attempts in real-time. This system aims to enhance cybersecurity by autonomously analyzing email content, identifying phishing patterns, and taking immediate defensive actions.

---

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

This project focuses on building an automated system to:
1. **Detect phishing emails** using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
2. **Respond autonomously** to phishing attempts by flagging, quarantining, or notifying users.
3. **Continuously improve** detection accuracy through user feedback and learning loops.

## üõ† **Key Components**

1. **Email Data Collection**  
   A curated dataset containing legitimate and phishing emails with key features such as email body, subject lines, sender details, and metadata.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) with LLMs**  
   Utilize fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., GPT or BERT) to detect suspicious phrases, unusual URLs, and common phishing patterns like urgency or requests for sensitive information.

3. **AI Agent for Classification**  
   Classifies emails as malicious or safe using insights from LLMs, along with metadata such as IP addresses and headers.

4. **Automated Response Agent**  
   Triggers immediate actions upon detection, such as:
   - Flagging emails for review.
   - Quarantining emails.
   - Notifying admins or users.
   - Blocking malicious senders.

5. **Continuous Learning**  
   Incorporates feedback loops to adapt and improve phishing detection over time.

6. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   A dashboard to display key metrics like:
   - Number of phishing emails detected.
   - False positives and false negatives.
   - Trends in phishing attempts over time.

## üîß **Technologies & Tools**

- **LLMs**: OpenAI GPT or fine-tuned BERT for text analysis.  
- **AI Agents**: Python-based automation with tools like Rasa or FastAPI.  
- **Datasets**: Phishing email datasets (e.g., Enron, PhishingCorpus).  
- **Cybersecurity APIs**: Integrate tools like VirusTotal for threat verification.  
- **Visualization**: Dashboards built using libraries like Plotly or Streamlit.  

---

## üéØ **Expected Outcome**

- A robust, automated phishing detection system reducing the risk of cyberattacks.  
- Proactive defense mechanisms enabling organizations to stay ahead of threats.  
- Demonstration of how LLMs enhance cybersecurity by analyzing and mitigating malicious communications.
